== DESCRIPTION:

Mailtrap is a mock SMTP server for use in Rails development.

Mailtrap waits on your choosen port for a client to connect and talks _just enough_ SMTP protocol for ActionMailer to successfully deliver its message.

Mailtrap makes *no* attempt to actually deliver messages and, instead, writes them into a file (hence the name 	Mail_trap_). Handy tip: use tail -f to see emails being received.

You can configure the hostname (default: localhost) and port (default: 2525) for the server and also where the messages get written (default: /var/tmp/mailtrap.log).
	
== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Lightweight, no setup
* Runs as a daemon with start, stop, etc..
* Tested with ActionMailer's SMTP delivery method
* Very, very, dumb ... might not work with an arbitrary SMTP client

== SYNOPSIS:

To use the defaults host:localhost, port:2525, file:/var/log/mailtrap.log

* mailtrap start

Customise startup:

* sudo mailtrap start --host my.host --port 25 --once --file=/var/log/messages.txt

(sudo because you want to use restricted port 25)
